    <h2>Experience is about the User. Creativity is about the Soul. Sustainability is for our Future.</h2>
    <p> It isn't enough to design for the next fast product. Products should be built to last, whether digital, traditional, or forward thinking into the future. Designing for accessiblity, easy use, and sustainability in product creates a stronger sense of community, a stronger sense of unity. My role as a UX Designer and Strategist is to help marry those concepts together to provide the best experience for the user, without sacrificing the principles of our responsiblity to each other and to our planet.</p>

        <h2>Artly, an auction app for art lovers</h2>
        <p><b>The Goal:</b> Create a mobile app that provides a service to a core demographic.</p><br />
        <p><b>The Process:</b> Using interviews with art buyers, competitor analysis, and design principles, this app is created with a neutral but inviting colour scheme and accessibility barriers in mind. 
          The product's user journey was to follow a common journey of an art buyer who wants to have an account and wants to bid on art pieces in cultivated auctions. This includes histories, clear bidding, and recommended products
        </p><br />
        <p><b>The Finished Product:</b>The final product was tested with users and produced a positive response and interest. Some adjustments were made from user feedback and peer review. This helped create a rounded product that met project goals.</p>

        <h2>PlantMD, your app for plant health!</h2>
        <p><b>The Goal:</b> Create a responsive web app that appeals to plant users who want to improve their plant care.</p><br />
        <p><b>The Process:</b> Following the goals of improved user experience, interviews with relevant users were conducted before, during, and after creation and ideation. Increasing the focus on the plant health aspect allowed for diversion from typical plant websites for sales and care, with a possible 'search for symptoms' function to improve the user experience.
          The product's user journey was to follow a common journey of an art buyer who wants to have an account and wants to bid on art pieces in cultivated auctions. This includes histories, clear bidding, and recommended products
        </p><br />
        <p><b>The Finished Product:</b>After creating both a web and mobile version, the app was tested among users and tested mostly positive. Changes were made based upon feedback and updates to UI helped improve the experience. The end product is a website that users can potentially utilize to search for plant symptoms and get expert plant care advice.</p>

        <p><b>The Goal:</b> Create a mobile app that would help jobseekers transition their career through various paths.</p><br />
        <p><b>The Process:</b> This app's process followed research and ideation with a strong focus on what users are looking for and what they need, which in job searching can be different things. By conducting interviews and competitor analysis, there was a gap between the options to either look for work directly or discover a new career path via training. 
        </p><br />
        <p><b>The Finished Product:</b>The result was a clean and easy to follow career path within an app that makes room for testing to see which path a user needs, such as career training or job searching. It would also make available additional help. Testing via users showed that the idea of additional help in a stressful situation was simplified and make more achievable using an app that is designed solely to help.</p>

              <h2> Who I am, What I'm about</h2>

              <p>I believe that everyone is born with creativity. But it is like strength building; with time and practice, you can utilize your creativity to overcome anything. I reached a turning point in my career and turned to designing for the social good, whether through brand strategy, user experience, or marketing strategy. </p>
              <p>
                Working in User Experience Design allows me to use my creative side with my analytical side to for strategy through careful research and execution. 
                With over 20 years in the design industry and 10 years in marketing, my career rounds out to someone who fully understands all the facets that come together to form a unique and cohesive voice and message. It isn't just about the message, and it isn't just about the media. It is about both and how they can come together to better serve our community, on all scales.</p>

            <h2>What I'm passionate about</h2>
            <p> The world is always changing and so are we. When it comes to work that I am passionate about, I search for meaning not only in the message, but in what it could mean to others and to myself.
              A fundamental part of the work that I do stands on the belief that I should do work that I believe in. It should have a positive impact and it should stand for something.
              As the old saying goes, if you stand for nothing, you will believe in nothing.
              <p>I am voracious learner and am passionate about social good, nonprofits, and sustainablity within the world. While not a luddite, I believe that our own creativity is how we must solve problems.
              </p>
            <hr /><p>Currently, I look for companies to partner with that believe in doing good for the community, no matter how big or small. I look for companies wanting to start in green technology and marketing, nonprofits, mental health champions, and community focussed solutions. If you have a company that needs help, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
